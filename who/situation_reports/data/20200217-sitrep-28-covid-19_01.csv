,"HIGHLIGHTS•No new countries reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.•From today, WHO will be reporting all confirmed cases, including bothlaboratory-confirmed as previously reported, and those reported as clinicallydiagnosed (currently only applicable to Hubei province, China). From 13February through 16 February, we reported only laboratory confirmed casesfor Hubei province as mentioned in the situation report published on 13February. The change in reporting is now shown in the figures. This accountsfor the apparent large increase in cases compared to prior situation reports.•Based on the evidence currently available about COVID-19, WHO hasdeveloped guidance documents for managing public health events at Pointsof Entry and mass gatherings. These are posted on WHO COVID-19 Points ofEntry and Mass Gatherings website. See Technical Focus for more details.•WHO Eastern Mediterranean office has updated information on COVID-19cases.
